  - difference between merge and rebase
    We can use either rebase or merge to combine two branches. Peoples are tend to use rebase over merge due to following facts.
    There is no additional commit added to the merged branches
    Rebase commit history is cleaner than merge history since rebase history does not have complex branches
    Due to the branch complexity in merged git tree, some code changes are invisible. But rebase changes come from a specific and entitled commit.
