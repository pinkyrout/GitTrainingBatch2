So I am tejas and i am writing details about IRCTC database schema.

So may be we will need 4 tables, for primary stage having only one functionality of booking train ticket.
The tables are listed below: 
1. train_info
2. station_info
3. user_info
4. booking_info

now lets see the entities of these table:
1. train_info: (train_id, name, start_station, end_staion, type, route)
2. station_info: (station_id, name, platform_count, trains_that_stop)
3. user_info: (user_id, age, sex, contact_number, email)
4. booking_info: (booking_id, user_id, train_id, source_station_id, destination_station_id, arrial_time, departure_time, coach_number, seat_number, fare)

For booking_info table we can simply put constrains on train_id, source_station_id, destination_station_id, coach_number, seat_number columes so we will be able to handle conflicts.

now the relationships of the tables mustr be like:

train_info and booking_info:         one to many ........... as each booking is w.r.t one train only and one train can contain many bookings.
user-info and booking_info:          one to many ........... as user can have many bookings and one booking is w.r.t one user only.
station_info and train_info:         many to many .......... as train can have multiple halts and also station can also have many trains stop there.
station_info and booking_info:       many to many .......... as station can be part of many bookings at a time and two stations are invauled in booking.
