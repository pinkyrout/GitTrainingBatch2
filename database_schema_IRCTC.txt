So I am tejas and i am writing details about IRCTC database schema.

So may be we will need 4 tables, for primary stage having only one functionality of booking train ticket.
The tables are listed below: 
1. train_info
2. station_info
3. user_info
4. booking_info

now lets see the entities of these table:
1. train_info: (train_id, name, start_station, end_staion, type, route)
2. station_info: (station_id, name, platform_count, trains_that_stop)
3. user_info: (user_id, age, sex, contact_number, email)
4. booking_info: (booking_id, user_id, train_id, source_station_id, destination_station_id, arrial_time, departure_time, coach_number, seat_number, fare)

For booking_info table we can simply put constrains on train_id, source_station_id, destination_station_id, coach_number, seat_number columes so we will be able to handle conflicts.
