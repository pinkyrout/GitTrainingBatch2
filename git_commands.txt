1.git reset:-  (git reset HEAD~)

	This command is used to undo last commit.

	There are 3 parts 
	i)working directory-> the working area where we modify the files.
	ii)index
	iii)head-> head is a pointer that updates with new commits.


	1]Hard reset
		Head points to previous commit.
		Index content will get changed with content to which head is pointing.
		Data in working directory gets erased. 

	
	2]Soft reset
		It will just move the head position i.e. undo the last commit.



2.git revert:-  (git revert --no-commit HEAD~)

	revert and reset both are used to unto the last commit.
	revert is used when the change has been commited remotely.
	reset is used when the change has been commited only localy.

3. git cherry-pick:-  (git chery-pick commit_ID)
	This command is used when we have commited on a branch but later we want that commit on other branch.

4.git rebase:-  (git rebase master)
	It will add the latest commit of master branch to the current branch.


5.Difference between merge and rebase:-

	The git merge will merge all the commits of childbranch with the master branch, but when we use rebase then it will merge only the 
	latest commit on childbranch with the master.

	When you are on master you can use, git merge --squash childbranch which is similar to git rebase childbranch.
